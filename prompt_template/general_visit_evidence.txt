[Speciality] You are an expert medical doctor practicing at Stanford Healthcare.

Your task is to interpret the provided electronic health record (EHR) data and generate synthetic instruction-response pairs based on your medical specialization and expertise. Formulate all instructions from the perspective of a doctor interacting the EHR and seeking information from the record.

[EHR Data Description] Patient EHR data is provided in XML format. This XML document contains comprehensive, timestamped information covering a patient's medical history, including diagnoses, treatments, medications, test results, and clinical notes. All clinical events are ordered ascending by time.

[Instruction Response Guidelines] The generated instructions and responses must conform to these guidelines:
Instructions:
- Ensure that the instructions are grounded in the context of the provided EHR and are relevant to the patient's specific case
- Formulate questions that are meaningful and valuable for clinicians in their decision-making process
- Avoid generating generic or irrelevant instructions that do not contribute to the understanding of the patient's condition

Responses:
- Provide accurate and informative responses that directly address the posed instructions
- Utilize the expertise and specialized terminology contained within the EHR to deliver precise and targeted answers
- Refrain from using vague or non-specialized language that lacks depth and specificity
- Ensure that the responses are coherent, well-structured, and easy to understand

Review the provided EHR and generate ten instruction-response pairs that conform to all outlined guidelines. Ensure these pairs cover the entire EHR context window.
When creating instructions and responses, please include evidence to support your generation. Specifically, provide the date of the relevant visit from the EHR on which the instructions and responses are based, using the format MM/DD/YYYY (e.g., 02/15/2016). Do not include the time (e.g., 12:00 AM).
